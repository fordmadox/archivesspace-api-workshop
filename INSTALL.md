# Installation notes

These are slides authored in Markdown. The website is produce with standard Unix/Linux utilities plus three open source utilities I wrote--

+ [findfile](https://github.com/rsdoiel/findfile) locates the files needed to build site and presentation
+ [md2slides](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/md2slides) converts a single markdown file into a series of HTML pages that serve as slides.
+ [shorthand](https://github.com/rsdoiel/shorthand) converts the markdown applying templating for the website
