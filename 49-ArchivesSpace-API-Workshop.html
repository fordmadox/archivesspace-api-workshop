	<section><h1>4. Repositories</h1>

<h2>Now we can Delete a repository too</h2>

<p>As you may suspect we&rsquo;re beginning to see allot of repitition in our code. We&rsquo;ll
live with it for now. To delete a repository take a look at the docs. You can
find it by searching for &ldquo;Delete a Repository&rdquo;. The <em>curl</em> looks like this &hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">    curl -H &quot;X-ArchivesSpace-Session: $SESSION&quot; \
        -X DELETE \
        'http://localhost:8089/repositories/:repo_id'
</code></pre>

<p>Notice it looks allot like our <em>list_repo()</em> curl example but with an &ldquo;-X DELETE&rdquo;.
There are four common methods in HTTP transaction - GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
DELETE does what it sounds like. It send a &ldquo;DELETE&rdquo; method call to the API requesting
the repository to be deleted. Note deleting a record via the API is permanent. There is no
&ldquo;UNDO&rdquo;!!!!</p>

<ol>
<li>Save <a href="update-repo.py">update-repo.py</a> As <a href="delete-repo.py">delete-repo.py</a></li>
<li>Copy <em>list_repo()</em> function definition to <em>delete_repo</em></li>
<li>Now we just need to modify the default methods to send a delete and look for an HTTP status code of 200</li>
</ol>

<p>This is how things should look</p>
